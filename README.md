I invented this game myself :)

**Rules of the game:**

- Three throws of the dice are given per turn.
- "5" counts as five points, "1" counts as ten points, the rest of the faces do not matter.
- Dice with "5" and "1" are being rerolled.
- Players take turns throwing the dice.
- Players make the same amount of turns.
- The winner is the player who reaches 100 points first or, if everyone reaches 100 points, the player with the biggest amount of points.
            
**How to play:**
            
- Press the button "ROLL!"
- If you want to reroll any dice on the next roll, select them by pressing
- And again the button "ROLL!"
- After the third throw, let the Android play
